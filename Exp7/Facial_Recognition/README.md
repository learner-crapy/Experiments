# Facial Recognition Using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and OpenCV

### GENERAL NOTES:
   This git repo includes some training photos, 40 photos for 3 people for a total of 120 photos to train with. 
   There is a sample photo that is used as a test to test the results of the training.
   
### VERY IMPORTANT: 
  There is a file, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, that must stay within the directory of the program,
  it is necessary for OPENCV python package.
  
  #### UPDATE 2018, not sure anymore with opencv3 ^
 
## DEPENDENCIES:
   1. OPENCV
   1. Numpy
   1. SciKit-Image AND SKlearn 
   1. Matplotlib
   1. Scipy
   1. PYTHON 3
   
## INSTALLING OPENCV
   Getting OPENCV installed can be really annoying. I strongly recommend using Homebrew to install it.
   If you dont have Homebrew installed, you can get it here: https://github.com/Homebrew/install
   
   After installing homebrew, run:
  ```
  brew install opencv
  ```
   
   This is where it gets really tricky depending how you have your python enviornments set up: IE: having python2 and python3
   and may even anaconda too. 
   I can explain it, but this link most certainly does a better job at it:
   https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-macos/
   
   If you need really help, you can send flag an issue and i'll get back relatively quickly.
   
 ## Results
   If you use the photos I provided, you'll get something around **80% success rate**, which is pretty good
   for a standard machine learning program but obviously not  the latest of the latest facial recog tools. 
   
 #### HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
